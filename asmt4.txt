Implementing the MCTS algorithm for an intelligent Othello Player

  =========================================================================
    For this assignment, you may work in pairs.
    Only one printout needs to be turned in for each pair.
  =========================================================================

You are given the following files which you should NOT change:

  basic-defns.lisp
  othello-macros.lisp
  othello-starter.lisp
  othello-the-rest.lisp

The "othello" files implement the game of Othello.  The "othello-macros.lisp"
file defines some low-level macros that are used in the other two "othello"
files.  (A "macro" is used like a function, but it has a different underlying
semantics.)

You are given the following file that contains contracts for the functions
you will need to define for your implementation of the MCTS algorithm:

  mcts.lisp

For comparison and general amusement, you are also given the following file,
which contains my implementation of the MCTS algorithm in compiled form:

  huns-mcts.fasl


--------------------------------------------
  TO BEGIN 
--------------------------------------------

Type:  (load "basic-defns.lisp")

To compile-and-load your (currently partial) implementation, type:  (maker)

(Ignore any warnings about variables not being used ... these warnings arise
because you haven't provided definitions for a lot of functions yet!)

To compile-and-load the implementation we saw in class, type:  (huns-maker)

(If you compile-and-load one version and then the other, you'll see a lot
of warnings about various functions/methods/operators being redefined.  You
can ignore them.)

TO PLAY A GAME:  

  (setf g (new-othello))

  (do-move! g nil 2 4)  ;; <--- Put a token in position (2 4)

  (uct-search g 1000 2) ;; <--- Ask system to compute a move using
                        ;;      1000 simulations and c = 2

  (apply #'do-move! g nil (uct-search g 1000 2))
       ;; same as above except here you also DO the move!

AFTER YOU HAVE DEFINED YOUR MCTS FUNCTIONS (or if you want to see my
MCTS functions in action), type:

  (compete 1000 2 100 2)

That will play out a game where black gets 1000 simulations per turn,
while white only gets 100; both players are using a "C" value of 2.
Black should win convincingly.

   **** NOTE:  The current implementation scores a win by
               the square-root of the difference in numbers of tokens.
	       For example, if black wins having 48 tokens to 16 for white,
	       then the score would be (sqrt (- 48 32)) = (sqrt 16) = 4.
	       For this reason, using a C value of 6 would probably be
	       more appropriate than 2 (which would be fine if wins/losses
	       were counted as 1 or -1).
	       
The COMPETE-NO-PRINTING function is similar, except that it only displays
the end result of the competition.  (It also displays a sequence of the
form "B W B W ..." to let you know who's thinking along the way.)

----------------------------------------------------
  To TEST your implementation
----------------------------------------------------

In a fresh interactions window session, type the following expressions:

(load "basic-defns.lisp")
(maker)
(dotimes (i 3)
  (compete-no-printing 100 2 1000 2))  ;; be sure to use COMPETE-NO-PRINTING!!!!
(dotimes (i 3)
  (compete-no-printing 1000 2 1000 1))

After that, run similar tests for at least 2 more combinations of inputs
to COMPETE-NO-PRINTING.

Then save your interactions and submit your asmt4 directory as usual:

  submit365 asmt4 your-asmt-4-directory
